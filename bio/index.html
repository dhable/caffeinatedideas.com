<h3>About Dan...</h3>
<p>
  Dan was first drawn to solving difficult problems after trying to build 
  his first time machine when he was seven. After earning his BS in computer 
  science from UWM, he headed west to escape the two-foot snow drifts. He&apos;s 
  been known to use funny phrases like &quot;uff da&quot; and &quot;bubbler.&quot; 
  Dan is currently co-founding jetway.io, occasionally corrupts the Code Fellows 
  JavaScript bootcamp with functional JavaScript and raising the next generation 
  of computer scientists.
