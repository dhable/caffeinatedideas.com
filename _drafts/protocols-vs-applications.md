Ever heard of [Slack][slack]? It's the new messaging platform that has captured
everyone attention.

As a communication tool for workers, [Slack][slack] and [Hipchat][hipchat] are
great. They provide a way for all the employees, regardless of location, to keep in
touch and have that quick conversation that would normally have been done standing
next to a desk. I live on [Hipchat][hipchat] for my current job and would recommend
it in a second.

Then, I was browsing the /r/functionalprogramming subreddit and ran across a
conversation about [Functional Slack][functional-slack], an "open" community of
developers that decided to use [Slack][slack] for their communication. It's not
just limited to this one group either.

The ironic part of this is that the new hot collaboration app that people can't
wait to use is a reimplementation of [Internet Relay Chat][irc]. Unlike
[Internet Relay Chat][irc], these new solutions are applications and not
protocols. It's a subitle difference but a very important one. Applications are
built, maintained, and licensed by a single entity, typically a for profit company.
Protocols are built and maintained through consensus of many people and published
openly for anyone to implement (usually).

Early on in the history of the Internet, engineers spent their time building
protocols and encourgaging people to build applications that used these protocols.
These efforts resulted in the protocols that form the basis of all data traffic
and enable just about every part of the web and mobile app ecosystem we enjoy
today.

Today, engineers build huge, closed applications that lock out the collaboration
of other developers while posting massive (and probably inflated) valuations. It
started with Facebook, then Twitter, Snapchat and now [Slack][slack]. They're only
a platform as long as they want to let you integrate with them. Just like Twitter,
they'll lock you out the minute they want that user base.
