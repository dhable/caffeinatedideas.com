    A silly stocking stuffer card game with a cute Wisconsin theme needs a little
    bit of tweaking with the rules to remain managable.

For Christmas I recieved a copy of [Deer in the Headlights][bgg-page] from Front Porch
Classics. It was one of those silly stocking stuffer presents that no one expects too
much from and this game fits the category perfectly. The rules that come with the game
are just too cumbersome as written. Instead of just throwing the game into the dark
corner of the closet, I attempted to tinker with the rules to see if the game could
be saved.

## How It's Played

Out of the box, Deer in the Headlights uses two standard playing card decks with jokers
removed and a set of three dice. You start by dealng *ALL* (yes, ALL) the cards to every
player. Each card has a point value and you want to get rid of all your cards. To accomplish
that feat, you role the three custom dice to determine what action to take next. Just what
action you take depends on the following chart:

The first player to get rid of all their cards ends the round. All of the other players
add up the points in their hand and score it on the bowling-like score sheet. You then
play another round. The overall winner is the player with the lowest score.

## ...But It's Broken

Game play is determined by your dice role. The cards are simply a convienent way to 
account for point values in your hand that can be discarded. There's nothing special about
them being playing cards per se.
