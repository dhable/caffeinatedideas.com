      description: There are a lot of log programs and recipe formulation programs that exist. Most 
        contain features that are beyond what I need as a weekend home brewer or lack features 
        that I'm looking for. Simple Brew Tool is designed to address those issues in a flexible 
        way. I'm writing the whole system in ClojureScript using the Om framework.

      description: Every large company goes through an exercise to inspect all the open source dependencies
        and ensure that the license is agreeable to their lawyers. This plugin was started to fulfill just
        that need after we failed to get existing plugins to work. grunt-simple-license will read the npm
        or bower license metadata field and produce a report. You can also set a default in your project's
        grunt file if the authors of the package didn't add the license field (tisk, tisk).

      description: When I started automating a series of integration tests using Vagrant as the virtual
        container, I discovered that there wasn't a good way to pause my grunt script until Vagrant was
        finished. The grunt-waitfor plugin solves this problem by blocking the grunt execution until a shell
        command (I used curl) completes successfully. The plugin was written for grunt 0.4.x.

        portal for his new clothing startup, ModBox. To facilitate the business, we launched a website 
        in three weeks that signs users up for the service, let's them develop a fit and interest profile 
        and securely captures their billing information to charge purchases to. The site was built Using 
        node.js (express, jade, mongoose), MongoDB, and Stripe.

      description: After fighting with MFC and VB DLL dependencies, I created a solution that used
        Perl, Perl/Tk and ActiveState Perl Tools to create a static, light weight utility program to automate
        various source control tasks. The wizard UI framework was extracted into a separate module so additional 
        utilities could follow the same pattern. After the project was done, the source code was open sourced 
        and published on the Internet and Lee Goddard volunteered to provide long term support for the module.
