      description: There are a lot of log programs and recipie formulation programs that exist. Most 
        contain features that are beyond what I need as a weekend homebrewer or lack features 
        that I'm looking for. Simple Brew Tool is designed to address those issues in a flexible 
        way. I'm writing the whole system in ClojureScript using the Om framework.

      description: When I started automating a series of intergration tests using Vagrant as the virtual
        container, I discovered that there wasn't a good way to pause my grunt script until Vagrant was
        finished. The grunt-waitfor plugin solves this problem by blocking the grunt execution until a shell
        command (I used curl) completes successfully. The plugin was written for grunt 0.4.x.
