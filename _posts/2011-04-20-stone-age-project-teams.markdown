Like everyone else in the industry, our team has embarked on the adventure to adopt 
a variety of agile practices over the last couple of years. First, we picked up scrum 
and started to develop features in iterations (despite our still waterfall like 
release model). After a few projects with scrum, many members of the team took up 
test driven development. After a lot of stumbling, we started to wrap our minds around 
TDD and writing good unit tests. Now, we have some team members that want to adopt 
pair programming. Yes, I\'ll admit that I\'m not a huge fan of pair programming but I 
tried a couple of sessions with a few different people. The whole time I couldn\'t get 
over the biggest problem that I\'ve found with pairing and that\'s the need for a team 
that works the same hours and is preferably co-located. In today\'s world of globally 
disperse teams, it seems wrong to sell people on the need to adopt a coding practice 
that requires a team from the 20th century.

I have a lot of friends that work as engineers of various types for manufacturing 
companies and they seem to provide a good roadmap for business as a whole. First, 
they faced the increased labor costs by sending out the tedious piece work to other 
countries with a cheaper labor market. As manufacturing learned to cope with this 
global product development process, additional pieces were moved over - advanced 
assembly, tech support and even engineering. Today, the large manufactures may have 
engineering teams in Europe and the US design a product that\'s built in Mexico and 
China and finally shipped to a customer in South Africa.

This is the kind of model that we need to get to with software and the pair programming 
camp has some good intentions but the wrong answer in the end. Instead, we need to start 
adopting a more social development pattern where we can clearly communicate with each 
other in asynchronous ways and accept feedback on our designs, code and ideas. Being 
more social instead of leaning on pair programming will enable companies to hire regardless 
of the geographic area and still produce a successful product at the end of the day. For 
proof that this model can work, we just need to look at the various open source projects. 
Each of them is leading the charge for better tools and working through the organizational 
issues that having a very distributed team offers. Despite time zones, geography and even 
language, these projects produce high quality software the the modern world depends on. 
There\'s no denying that this model has great success and I\'d like to see the agile camp 
work through some of the cons instead of continuing to promote the ineffective technique 
of pair programming.
