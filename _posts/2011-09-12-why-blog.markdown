I recently started reading the book [Coders At Work: Reflections on the Craft of 
Programming][coders-at-work] and this snippet between Peter Seibel and Jamie 
Zawinski jumped out at me.

When I started writing this blog, I knew it wasn\'t because I had some divine 
insight to share with the world. My main goal was self improvement by forcing 
myself to sit down and construct a well defined block of text. From here, I 
would gain practice into writing so my emails, code reviews, wiki pages, comments 
would be clearer. I never once gave any thought to the idea that writing could 
also help with my development until now.
