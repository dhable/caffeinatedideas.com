Every morning, I start my day getting caught up on the tech news and latest 
happenings in the world. All of these products continue to tout their social 
capabilities or how they perform better with a social effect. Everywhere you 
turn, it seems that tech companies are baking a social aspect into their products. 
Is this always a good idea and should the inclusion of these social features help? 
That depends entirely on the social forces involved.

For a few years now, we\'ve heard about the social effect and how it\'s helped increase 
users. RIM\'s BBM program has been wildly successful in bringing new users into the devices, 
powered all by a simple list of people you connect with. Yet, I\'ve been troubled that the 
concept seems over general. In particular, I\'m troubled that some of these social forces 
seem to lose their power when the users leave. Sticking with BBM, the application loses 
any amount of pull for me if everyone I know and communicate with happen to use iPhones. 
In that case, the iMessage app has all the power until my friends decide to switch back 
to BlackBerries.

Just like electrical forces in nature, social forces seem to belong to two different camps - weak 
social forces and strong social forces. A weak social force is one where the entire social 
value for the user is based on people they want to interact with also using the software, 
product or system. Communication andÂ collaboration products fit into this camp. A strong social 
force is one where the social value doesn\'t come from who you interact with but instead the 
activity is better when you interact with someone else. Games and gaming are a strong example 
here - I don\'t care who I play on XBox Live but the games seem more fun when I\'m playing 
against another human with the same skill level instead of the computer AI.
