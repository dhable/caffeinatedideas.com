## There Is No Certinanty In Life

At some point in our lives, we\'re given this misconception that with effort we can have some level of certianty about the future. On a small

then there is still a small level of uncertianly that I won\'t and the outcome of that action will make for a pretty wild day. In fact, there
is no industry that understand that nothing in life is certian like the medical profession. Ask any doctor to comment about a prognosis and
they will ___never___ discount the very slim possibilities in life.
