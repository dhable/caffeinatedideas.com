  Discovering new, quality podcasts that cover software development is a great
  way to utilize commuting time to sharpen your skills. Here I list four
  podcasts I think are fantastic for expanding the mind of any developer.

When I used to commute to the office in Seattle, I would listen to a number of
development related podcasts. They were a great way to get exposed to new
trends as well as wake up my brain before getting to the office. This is a list
of a few of my favorite podcasts that have withstood the test of time. Let's jump
right into the list.

##### [The Cognicast][cognicast]

Primarily focused on Clojure and ClojureScript development, this podcast always
seems to come up with interesting topics to talk about. Previous shows have
included deep dives into Om, property based testing, writing code without a
type system, data structures, dyslexia and more. It's roughly an hour long, has
a consistent release schedule and a wide range of guests.

##### [JavaScript Jabber][js-jabber]

This was one of the first podcasts that I really started listening to back when
QThru was introducing node.js as a supported technology. While I've moved on from
those days, so has JavaScript Jabber. The show isn't afraid to take on newer
topics in the JS world, like property based testing. Also, the hosts have a style
that ensures they loop back around and explain topics that people may not be
familiar with. At times it they can get hung up on the JS framework of the week
but overall a solid mix.

##### [Hanselminutes][hanselminutes]

Not specifically about development, Scott Hanselman is an excellent podcaster.
The podcast is consistently 30 minutes long and the range of topics is incredible.
Everything related to technology, from 3D printers to home routers not being
updated, are discussed. The show does tend to favor the .Net platform but often
does so in a way that topics can be borrowed by other platforms.

##### [Functional Geekery][fn-geekery]

This is by far the podcast that pushes my functional programming limits but the
pace of shows seems to have ground to a halt. This show is all about the functional
languages like Erlang, Haskell, Idris with a bit of Scala and Clojure mixed in.
I find myself often times revisiting older episodes and researching a number of
topics discussed by the guests. The shows length seemed to vary a bit and new
episodes are published very infrequently. It's a shame because this was the place
to learn more about advanced functional programming.

Do you have a favorite development podcast that's updated on a regular basis?
