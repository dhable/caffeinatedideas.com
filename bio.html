  Dan was first drawn to solving difficult problems after trying to 
  build his first time machine when he was seven. After earning his BS in 
  Computer Science from UWM, he headed west to escape the two-foot snow 
  drifts and use of funny phrases like "uff da" and "bubbler." It's no 
  surprise he has taken refuge in Ballard.
