In the last couple of months, I've had some interesting conversations with my employer
about my career. Frankly, I'm not sure what I want to do next. One thing that has come
out of these conversations is a simple abstraction I've used to think about different
positions and what they do. I've based it on the [Five W's][five-ws].

* Who (individual assignments) - Team Lead
* What - Product Management
* When - Project Management
* Where (which team) - Engineering Manager
* Why - CTO
* How - Architect, Tech Lead

There are plenty of corner cases but at least having some high level abstraction has
given me some guidance.
