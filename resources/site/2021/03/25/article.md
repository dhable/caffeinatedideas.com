As I mentioned [last April][1], I ended up switching jobs and found myself in a Scala
shop that embraced the [Typelevel][2] functional programming style. As I worked on tickets
and shippped features, I started to deep dive into the cats library. Many of the concepts
made my life easier and so I sarted to share them internally in a learning slack channel.

It then dawned on me that they might also be useful for others. As time permits, I'm going
to clean up the slack posts and start a new series - This Week In Cats. It's probably a mistake
to committing to a weekly post but that's the name of the series in slack.

Hopefully it proves useful to others as well.
