With 2020 closing in on the half way point, it's time to reflect back on the goals
I had set this year and see how they're holding up. 

## Reviewing the Q2 Updated Plan

Going into Q2, I made a lot of adjustments to my tech radar goals when I moved
to [Rally][rally]. The move to Rally was a very positive change but required ramping
up on [Scala][scala] - something I did not anticipate at the beginning of the year.
So, how did I do on my new list?

### Exploring: [TLA+][tla]

No significant progress on this goal and I don't think there will be much movement
on this topic until sometime in Q3/Q4 of 2020.

### Deep Dive: [Rust][rust]

Again, no significant progress on this goal either. I do plan on resuming learning
about [Rust][rust] starting in Q3. This month, I learned that [PicoBrew][picobrew] 
laid off the employees and now going through the receivership process. While their 
online services are still running to support my [Zymatic][zymatic], that might change. 
I figure working on a small Raspberry PI implementation of the backend service is a 
good fit for [Rust][rust] and where I'm thinking I'll apply my new knowledge.

### Deep Dive: [Generative Testing][gen-testing]

There was some question as to how [generative testing][gen-testing] would be recieved
at [Rally][rally]. This week I just completed my first test cases using the 
[Cats Law testing][law-testing] framework for some new code I've been working on. I 
suspect this will become an adopt as I get more comfortable with [ScalaCheck][scala-check].

### Adopting: [Scala][scala]

This has been my focus for the last quarter. I've managed to come up to speed enough
that I've been commiting PRs to production code bases at [Rally][rally]. I've finished working
through [Programming in Scala][scala-book] and about half finished with
[Functional Programming in Scala][red-book]. I've also been to two [CASE][case] virtual meetups
just to start connecting with the local community.


## The Q3 Plan (so far)

The Q2 goals felt solid and aligned nicely with life at this point. I don't see any
big topics that need to be shifted around or dropped at this point. Things I'm going
to commit to are:

* Finishing [Functional Programming in Scala][red-book]
* Finish the [Functional Structures in Scala][fsis-yt] YouTube videos
* Resume reading [Programming Rust][rust-book]
* Start a [Zymatic][zymatic] local server project with [rust][rust]
