In April 2012, I ended up meeting with Aaron Roberts for lunch. I had just left
BlackBerry for another position that didn't quite live up to my expectations.
A few days prior, Aaron and I talked about a startup he was building called
QThru. Before we got too far into lunch, I flat out asked him if he had room
for another developer and we talked about how to proceed. After a quick meeting
with the existing dev team, I walked away from a paying job with benefits to
become the first, and currently unpaid, full time employee for QThru.

To this day, I get a lot of questions from people who want to build out a
similar idea to QThru's self checkout solution. I don't have time to answer
every email. Over the series of a number of blog posts, I'll document as best
as I can recall what QThru was and what we had tried to build. Hopefully
founders looking to jump into the same space can avoid our mistakes.

To start at the end, QThru is no longer alive. Everyone in the company was
informed on 8 July 2013 that we had not received the latest tranche from our
investor and that the company had no money for payroll. The company existed in
this zombie like state until 30 September 2013 when the board voted to have
the corporation file Chapter 7 bankruptcy. There was an effort by the investor
to attempt to relaunch the company with a new CEO but after the Chapter 7
filing, the asserts became property of the courts and that effort ceased.

We learned a lot through the process and over the following blog posts, I'd
like to share those lessons so others can avoid our mistakes.
