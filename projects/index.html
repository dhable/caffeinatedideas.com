        Jetway is a startup project that I'm currently building with <a href="http://bmackerman.com/">Brian Ackerman</a>
        and Mark Franklin. We're currently keeping things quiet but busy building out our mobile solution using 
        <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a> for the mobile clients, <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> 
        for the desktop clients and <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> with a slew of modules for the backend service.
        In addition to cranking out code, I've been defining the business plan and working through the legal formation issues
        associated with a new startup.

        <p>
        There are a lot of log programs and recipie formulation programs that exist. Most contain features that are beyond 
        what I need as a weekend homebrewer or lack features that I'm looking for. Simple Brew Tool is designed to address
        those issues in a flexible way. I'm writing the whole system in 
        <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a> using the 
        <a href="https://github.com/swannodette/om">Om</a> framework.
